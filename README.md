# Kaggle Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of data science projects that I have completed on Kaggle. These projects serve as my portfolio, showcasing my data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning skills.

## Projects

The projects included in this repository are:

- [Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 13 - Cluster analysis - prognosis](https://github.com/caiocsn/Kaggle-Projects/blob/main/clustering-symptoms-patterns.ipynb)
- [Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 12 - Cluster analysis](https://github.com/caiocsn/Kaggle-Projects/blob/main/catboost-cluster-analysis.ipynb)
- [Playground Series - Season 3, Episode 12 - Residue analysis](https://github.com/caiocsn/Kaggle-Projects/blob/main/single-variable-calc-residue-analysis.ipynb)

## How to Use

You can use these projects to get a sense of my data science skills and experience. Each project includes a Jupyter Notebook containing the code I used to complete the project, as well as a brief summary of the project and its findings.

To view the projects, simply click on the project folder you are interested in and then click on the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb). You can also clone this repository to your local machine and run the Jupyter Notebooks on your computer.
